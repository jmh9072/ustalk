NOTE: The beanstalkd implementation is not complete. I am writing this documentation as I go.

Here are the steps you should take to get beanstalkd up and running [note: code not implemented]:

Step 1:
Install and start beanstalkd

Step 2:
Install python and python-yaml (to get a speed increase from libyaml, you must set that in the configuration. look at http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation for details)
Install mysql-python (MySQLdb)


Step 3:
Bring beanstalkd online (probably a good idea to put it in your startup scripts):
beanstalkd -l 127.0.0.1 -p 11300

Step 4:
Edit your ustalk local config, add
	'beanstalk' => array(
		'host' => '127.0.0.1',
		'tube' => 'ustalk'
	)
